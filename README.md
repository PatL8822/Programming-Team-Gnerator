# Programming-Team-Generator

## Description

I built a program team generator deployable via command line. This would have helped  with 
setting your team up with a good leadership  structure. The ability of recording information of the individual and putting it in a business web page for anyone to see proper contact information and teams. As I was developing this project I had so many setbacks unfortunately but one of the biggest takeaways I had is that. The parameters set in the constructor and super in the test files need to be in the same order. Otherwise you can be calling a name and returning an email.
